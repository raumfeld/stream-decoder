==============
Stream-Decoder
==============

The stream-decoder is a daemon that fetches audio streams by HTTP and
decodes them so that another process can access the decoded stream over
a named pipe.

stream-decoder uses GStreamer for decoding. Some elements of the
decoding process such as resampling and format conversion have been
moved out of the GStreamer pipeline and are done by the stream-decoder
itself for performance reasons.


-----
Usage 
-----

The stream-decoder is designed to run as separate process.  A client
communicates with it using D-Bus using the com.raumfeld.StreamDecoder
service.
